  <h3 class="text ideabody">Week 1: Introduction</h3>
  <h4 class="text ideabody">Documentation</h4>
  <p class="text ideabody">The first thing I had to do this week was come up with the aesthetic theme I wanted to achieve for my website.
    For inspiration, I looked at a few engineering portfolio websites online, and I especially liked the ones that involved images of different
    projects.  I picked a gray background because it looked professional and practical, while also allowing the images and text to
    be clearly seen, and I got the images off of Google since I don't have any of my own images to draw off of yet.  Perhaps as I 
    start to take pictures of my own work, I will be able to update these cover images with my own photos.
  </p>
  <p class="text ideabody">For the design of the website, I used a few features downloaded off of Bootstrap.  The rest I coded myself
    using HTML tags, including p, h1, and ul.  I was already a bit familiar with Bootstrap and HTML thanks to CS50, so I had fun playing
    around with different options when designing this website.  I also added to the css page that had already been created,
    in order to increase the customization of certain parameters such as font and page design.  
    For example, I chose to have the Final Projects tab be in the nav-bar because it seems more important than simply a weekly assignment, and I wanted 
    to be able to reference it more easily and quickly.  For my "About" page, I used a template that I found on Bootstrap, and adapted
    it for my own particular considerations.    
  </p>
  <p class="text ideabody">There are definitely aspects of my HTML and CSS code that could be more streamlined, and I consider this website a work in progress
    that I will continue adding to and updating throughout the course.
  </p>
  <p class="text ideabody">The next major assignment of the week was to think of a final project idea.  I live in Los Angeles, which is very hot nearly 
    all year round, and the public transportation is sorely lacking in many ways.  These two considerations led me to think of an idea
    that could help temperature-regulate both houses as well as smaller structures such as bus stops, which could help encourage more 
    people to take public transportation (if they don't have to be baking in the hot sun without shade while waiting for their bus).
    I know that black rooves absorb heat while white rooves reflect heat, and so I decided to build upon this simple principle to think
    of a concept of a reversible tile that could provide both reflection and absorption depending on the outside temperature.  This is 
    an exciting project to me because I think it is a cool way to combine microcontroller aspects with a more mechanical component 
    (needed to achieve the actual flipping of the tiles); moreover it is personally important to me because I feel that it could be 
    useful in my city (and elsewhere) especially as climate change becomes an ever more pressing issue.
  </p>
  <p class="text ideabody">I don't have really any experience with fabricating, so I don't yet know exactly how this project will play out, or even whether it
    is feasible (or perhaps too simple).  Nevertheless, I am extremely excited to get started with everything and see how it goes!
