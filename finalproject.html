    <h3  class="text ideabody">Smart Roof: Temperature Regulating Tiles</h3>
    <h4 class="text ideabody"><font color="navy">9.12.2023</font></h4>
    <h4 class="text ideabody">Initial Project Proposal</h4>
    <ul  class="text ideabody">Black rooves absorb heat, which raises the temperature of the building, while white rooves reflect heat,
      keeping the building cooler.  For maximum temperature efficiency year round, I propose a tile that has one black face (of an
      absorbant material) and one white face (of a reflective material).  The tile will have temperature and light sensors which allow
      it to determine how hot and sunny it is.  Above a certain temperature and light threshold, the tiles will automatically flip to their white
      face in order to cool down the building.  Below the threshold, the tiles will flip to their black side to increase heat retention 
      in the building.  This could also involve a more complicated algorithm that takes in information about the temperature and light
      in order to calculate the exact percentage of tiles that should be black versus white in order to achieve the ideal temperature inside
      the building.  I am also interested in having the tiles harness the energy of the sun's heat to power their flipping.  I foresee this being 
      particularly useful in structures such as bus stops and picnic pavillions, which are mostly outdoors and rarely regulated by air conditioning and heating.  
      These structures are often subject to extreme temperatures, and as climate change increases, it is more important than ever to have 
      better temperature regulating systems in structures that serve the public.  Moreover, the tiles could also be used on the rooves of houses
      and other buildings.  I plan to mount the tiles on some sort of flat board structure which can be attached on top of existing rooves,
      eliminating the need to re-shingle any rooves.  
    </ul>
    <p class="text ideabody">Considerations:</p>
    <ul class="text ideabody">The tiles will need to be water, sun, and weather resistant.</ul>
    <ul class="text ideabody">The tiles should all flip simultaneously to prevent them from hitting and blocking each other. </ul>
    <ul class="text ideabody">Potential of having the tiles adjust angle as well to maximize sun exposure in cold times.</ul>
    <h4 class="text ideabody"><font color="navy">10.11.2023</font></h4>
    <h4 class="text ideabody">Preliminary 3D Model</h4>
    <p class="text ideabody">The "smart roof" will consist of columns of shutters, where all the slats are linked together by a central shaft (dowel).
      The dowel will be pulled up or down by a servo motor perched on top of the column: the rotation of the arm of the servo upwards will pull the dowel up,
      thus closing the shutters, while the movement of the arm in the other direction will push the dowel down, closing the shutters but with the opposite side of the 
      slats facing out.  This is important because I will have one face of the shutters painted black (a heat absorbant color), while the other face
      will be painted white (heat reflective).  The system will know whether to pull the dowel up or down based on light and temperature sensors located on the
      frame of the shutter.  When the light/heat is above a certain threshold (which I will likely determine by a function that takes both heat and light into account),
      the motor will move such that the white side faces out.  Below the threshold, the black side will be facing out.  This will then help temperature regulate 
      the space beneath the roof, whether that be a bus stop shelter, a house, or perhaps even a vehicle.  Here is the 3D model I created in Fusion. 
    </p>
    <img class="diagram ideabody" src="shutters_3d.png">
    <p class="text ideabody">In this diagram, the gray box on the upper left corner of the frame schematically represents the temperature and light sensors.  One 
      consideration I have to keep thinking about is that it would likely be more practical to have the temperature sensor measure the temperature of the room underneath 
      the roof: after all, if it is cold outside but the room happens to be hosting a party with lots of body heat, perhaps it would be better for the roof to reflect heat to cool
      the building, rather than absorb sunlight.  I didn't include it in the diagram, but there will be wires linking the sensor to the servo motor, depicted on top 
      of the frame here.  I will also need to figure out where to locate the breadboard and Arduino.  Preferably, I will be able to use a smaller version 
      of these so it isn't so bulky, but either way I will probably need to build a small housing for the circuitry which will be attached to the frame.
    </p>
    <p class="text ideabody">In terms of the motor aspect of this system, the schematic shown here does not accurately represent what a servo motor looks like.  My idea is to have 
      the arm of the servo motor positioned such that its rotation is exactly parallel to the vertical path the dowel will take.  It will be somehow attached to the dowel (for example, with 
      something like a straw which can be easily tuned to the exact length necessary, but preferably more elegant in appearance.  However, I am not sure if a straw 
      might be too stiff to allow for the servo to properly pull the dowel--this is something I will need to play around with).  Thus, when the servo motor
      swivels upward, it will pull the dowel shaft upwards in an arcing motion.  When the servo arm swivels downward, it will push the dowel shaft The arc motion 
      is important because if the dowel were merely jerked straight upward, the slats would not turn properly: when opening these shutters, you need to pull the dowel out a
      little and then up in order to accomodate the arc of the slats themselves (as they do not have a constant rotational diameter). 
    </p>
    <p class="text ideabody">Each slat will be attached to two pins on either end (which I will probably screw into the wood), which will slot into evenly spaced holes in the 
      frame.  The holes have to be big and deep enough to allow for these slats to smoothly rotate.  Additionally, each slat will be attached to the dowel by a set of interlocking 
      threaded eyelets, which will allow for more free motion between the dowels and the slats.  
    </p>
    <p class="text ideabody">This model shown here only depicts one column of shutters.  I envision my final project including multiple columns all next to each other and attached to each other,
      something large enough to cover a small roof.  The other advantage of having multiple columns attached together is that each column doesn't necessarily have to be flipped to
      the same color.  This could potentially allow for more fine-tuned temperature regulation.  I still have to figure out what I want the scale of each column to be.
    </p>
    <p class="text ideabody">This is still quite a rough idea and I had a pretty difficult time modeling everything properly in Fusion, so this model definitely isn't fully accurate.
      However, it does capture the general idea, and it was helpful for me to make to get a better idea of how everything will fit together spatially.

    <p class="text ideabody">I have managed to build a set of shutters (out of cardboard) and get the mechanical/motorized motion of the shutters to work.  See Week 7 Documentation for more details.

<h4 class="text ideabody"><font color="navy">12.10.2023</font></h4>
<h4 class="text ideabody">Physical Construction</h4>
<p class="text ideabody">Since the whole point of my project is to produce tiles that will be mounted onto a roof, the first step of moving fom the minimum viable product, shown above, 
  to the final version was to change the material from cardboard to something less flimsy and more durable that could (more or less) withstand the elements.  
  I chose to use wood.  I was able to adapt my original Fusion360 model for the frame and louvers and transfer it to wood.  For the side planks of the frame in the cardboard version, 
  I did not model the holes for the louver axles.  Rather, I printed out just a flat sheet of cardboard and drilled the holes in afterwards so I could better measure them
  out by hand.  But for this version, since I already had the cardboard model to go off of, I was able to model the distance between holes in Fusion so that it printed 
  out already with holes.  This eliminated risk of error and inaccuracy that might arise if I drilled by hand.  Another problem I had to address was that in the 
  cardboard version, when the frame is laid on a flat surface, the louvers will scrape against the surface as they flip, which impedes their motion.
  I thus had to make the frame thicker so that the louvers were raised further up and could have more clearance with the ground surface, allowing 
  them to rotate without impedance. Here is the Fusion model I used for the frame side, holes included.
</p>
<img class="image ideabody" src="frameside.png">
<p class="text ideabody">Before attaching the pieces of the frame to each other, I had to suspend the louvers between them.  Here I encountered a problem.
  In the cardboard version, the louver axle was a piece of wood dowel that I had jammed into the side of the cardboard rectangle, between the flutes.  Obviously,
  wood does not have flutes, so I would have to come up with a different way to attach the axle.  I could not simply glue the wood dowel to one face of the shutter,
  because then it would not rotate with a consistent radius -- that is to say, I needed to attach the dowel exactly to the edge of the wood piece and not to either face.
  But because the wood piece is not very thick, there was not much surface area on the edge onto which to glue the dowel.  Moreover, glue would be a messy and flimsy solution. 
  I had initially envisioned using a 3D printed connector piece like the one I had used in the cardboard version, which would clamp to the louver and have a hole on the other 
  side into which the wooden dowel could be glued.  However, I realized that I could eliminate the need for glue by simply designing a piece that included both the clamping 
  part and the axle dowel itself.  With this in mind, I made a joint-dowel hybrid where one half clamped to the wood piece and the other half
  had a cylindrical protruding axle piece that could be threaded through the hole of the frame.  Here is the piece I designed in Fusion.  
  I designed the width of the clamp part to exactly match the thickness of the wood louvers, so the piece can simply slide onto the louver and 
  stay in place without any glue.
 </p>
<img class="image ideabody" src="njoint.png">
<p class="text ideabody">I next had to devise a way to attach each louver to the central dowel that would allow all of them to move in unison.  In the cardboard model,
  I made makeshift eyelets by wrapping pieces of wire around the central dowel and linking them to loops of wire stuck into the flutes of the cardboard louvers.
  This worked decently well; however, it involved a lot of tedious and inefficient manual labor, and also was imperfect because sometimes the wrapped
  wire would slip along the central dowel, preventing the louvers from all moving together in unison.  My first idea to fix this was to 3D print eyelets that 
  were already looped through each other, thus eliminating the tiresome step of wrapping and interlinking wire by hand.  Essentially, the eyelet had to have one segment 
  that would clamp onto each louver, and another segment that would be attached to the central dowel.  These two segments had to be connected to each 
  other such that movement of one prompted movement of the other, but there also had to be some freedom of motion between them since the louvers do not turn 
  with constant radius.  To this effect, this was the piece I designed (the central dowel would be threaded through the rectangular tunnel piece of each eyelet, one 
  eyelet per louver.)
</p>
<img class="image ideabody" src="singleeyelet.png">
<p class="text ideabody">The left photo below shows how the eyelet links the louver to the dowel in close up, and the right photo shows how all the 
  louvers (with their axles attached) were attached to the central dowel.
</p>
<img class="image ideabody" src="eyeletattached.png">
<img class="image ideabody" src="all1.png">
<p class="text ideabody">However, this did not work as well as I had hoped.  The main problem was that the rectangular tunnel part was either too narrow for the central dowel,
  such that I could not even thread them on, or it was wide enough to thread them on but then the fit was too loose such that they would slip around.
  This was a big issue since the whole point was that the connection to the central dowel would not slip so they could move in unison.  I realized that I 
  could solve this problem by designing a 3D printed piece that included all the eyelets as well as the central dowel, already attached.  Thus,
  rather than having to thread each eyelet onto the central dowel and get the fit exactly right, it would just come off the 3D printer as one big 
  piece already ready to use.  Here is the piece I ended up designing and printing.
</p>
<img class="image ideabody" src="doweleyelet.png">
<p class="text ideabody">As you can see, it was a bit too big for the Prusa printer, but I was able to solve this by rotating it and having it print 
  diagonally.  It was actually quite simple to design this in Fusion: I just took my original eyelet design, copied it nine times (once for each louver), lined 
  them up, and then extruded a rectangular beam through the tunnels of all nine of them.  I thus had a central dowel with nine eyelets already attached.
  This shape required a lot of supports to print, and so it was quite difficult to extricate after it finished printing.  After a lot of hard work 
  chipping away at the plastic with scissors, wire cutters, and box cutters, I managed to get a somewhat clean product.  
</p>
<p class="text ideabody">The next order of business was to color my louvers.  Since the whole point of my project is that the tiles turn black 
  when it is cold out and white when it is hot out, it is really important that they actually have these colors.  With the cardboard version, I had 
  tried painting the louvers, which I did not enjoy because it got extremely messy and did not produce an even coat.  This time, I decided to color 
  the louvers with vinyl stickers instead.  I used the box cutters to cut out strips of black and white vinyl of the exact size of the louvers, and stuck them 
  to either side.  Now, my louvers were properly colored.  At this point, I was able to attach all of them to the central dowel and their own axles,
  and then insert them properly into the frame and assemble the frame around them.
</p>
<p class="text ideabody">The next step was to figure out where I would place the stepper motor I was using to rotate the louvers.</p>
