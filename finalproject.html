    <h4  class="text ideabody">Smart Roof: Temperature Regulating Tiles</h4>
    <ul  class="text ideabody">Black rooves absorb heat, which raises the temperature of the building, while white rooves reflect heat,
      keeping the building cooler.  For maximum temperature efficiency year round, I propose a tile that has one black face (of an
      absorbant material) and one white face (of a reflective material).  The tile will have temperature and light sensors which allow
      it to determine how hot and sunny it is.  Above a certain temperature and light threshold, the tiles will automatically flip to their white
      face in order to cool down the building.  Below the threshold, the tiles will flip to their black side to increase heat retention 
      in the building.  This could also involve a more complicated algorithm that takes in information about the temperature and light
      in order to calculate the exact percentage of tiles that should be black versus white in order to achieve the ideal temperature inside
      the building.  I am also interested in having the tiles harness the energy of the sun's heat to power their flipping.  I foresee this being 
      particularly useful in structures such as bus stops and picnic pavillions, which are mostly outdoors and rarely regulated by air conditioning and heating.  
      These structures are often subject to extreme temperatures, and as climate change increases, it is more important than ever to have 
      better temperature regulating systems in structures that serve the public.  Moreover, the tiles could also be used on the rooves of houses
      and other buildings.  I plan to mount the tiles on some sort of flat board structure which can be attached on top of existing rooves,
      eliminating the need to re-shingle any rooves.  
    </ul>
    <p class="text ideabody">Considerations:</p>
    <ul class="text ideabody">The tiles will need to be water, sun, and weather resistant.</ul>
    <ul class="text ideabody">The tiles should all flip simultaneously to prevent them from hitting and blocking each other. </ul>
    <ul class="text ideabody">Potential of having the tiles adjust angle as well to maximize sun exposure in cold times.</ul>
